# Hash Maps

Hash map and frequency-based solutions for counting, tracking, and analysis problems.

- **delete-occurrences-n-times.py** - Frequency-based filtering with limits
- **find-the-odd-number.py** - Finding elements with odd frequencies

### character-analysis/
- **greed-is-good.py** - Character frequency with scoring rules
- **scramblies.py** - Character availability checking with hash maps

## Core Concepts

- **Frequency counting** - Tracking occurrences of elements
- **Hash map operations** - Efficient key-value storage and lookup
- **Character analysis** - String processing using frequency data
- **Set operations** - Unique element tracking and comparison

## Common Techniques

- Using dictionaries for O(1) lookups
- Counter objects for frequency analysis
- Set operations for uniqueness checks
- Hash map iteration for pattern detection

## Time Complexities

- **Building hash map**: O(n)
- **Lookup operations**: O(1) average case
- **Frequency analysis**: O(n) with hash maps
- **Character counting**: O(n) with fixed alphabet
