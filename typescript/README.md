# TypeScript CodeWars Solutions

This directory contains TypeScript solutions organized by algorithmic categories for effective learning and practice.

## Categories

- **arrays/** - Array manipulation and transformation problems
- **hashmaps/** - Frequency counting and hash map applications
- **stacks/** - Stack-based validation and processing solutions
- **strings/** - String manipulation, filtering, and analysis
- **math/** - Mathematical operations and number theory
- **two-pointers/** - Two-pointer techniques for efficient solutions

## TypeScript Features

- **Strong typing** - Type-safe implementations
- **Interfaces** - Structured data definitions
- **Generics** - Reusable type-safe solutions
- **Functional programming** - Array methods and arrow functions

## Usage

Each category demonstrates specific algorithmic patterns using TypeScript's type system. Use these examples to:

- Learn TypeScript idioms for common algorithms
- Study typed implementations of classic problems
- Practice functional programming patterns
- Understand type-safe data structure usage

## Benefits of TypeScript for Algorithms

- Compile-time error checking
- Better code documentation through types
- Improved IDE support and autocompletion
- Clearer intent with explicit types
