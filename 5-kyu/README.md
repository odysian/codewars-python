### [Perimeter of squares in a rectangle](https://www.codewars.com/kata/559a28007caad2ac4e000083/train/python)
- Use Fibonacci sequence and multiply result by 4

### [Can you get the loop](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52a89c2ea8ddc5547a000863/train/python)
- Linked list loop
- Floyd's algorithm uses two pointers. One moves fast, one moves slow. If they meet theres a loop. Then count steps around the loop.

### [Pick peaks](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5279f6fe5ab7f447890006a7/train/python)
- Sliding window
- Scan for peaks, handle plateau edge cases with pointers or alternate approach could store the index of the start of a peak.
- Fun problem to work through

### [Pagination Helper](https://www.codewars.com/kata/515bb423de843ea99400000a/train/python)
- OOP
- Zero indexes made the problem interesting. Good bit of division/modulo that took some thought.

### [Sum of Pairs](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54d81488b981293527000c8f/train/python)
- Two sum but return numbers, not indexes
- Used a set for better perfomance

### [Integers: Recreation One](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55aa075506463dac6600010d/train/python)
- Square numbers and nested loop
- Required decent optimization to pass tests. Only looping through until the sqrt of a number cut down runtime.

### [Count IP Addresses](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526989a41034285187000de4/train/python)
- Math trick, knowing how to calculate octets in base 256

### [Best Travel](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55e7280b40e1c4a06d0000aa/train/python)
- Use itertools.combinations, nested loops with a large k var would require advanced algorithm
- Sum totals of combinations, check if under limit and return the max total
